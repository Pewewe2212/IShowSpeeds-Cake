These items CANNOT be sold, shared, or put on any other website.

They are sized for use in Smile Game Builder BUT can be used for 
other Engines such as Unity, RPG Maker, and any other engine that
uses 3D Models.

These are multi-use for your many projects.

Credits must be given to.. SDAssets ..with a link to where you got 
this pack from.

These models are not animated, doors dont open/close but we allow
for them to be edited by you for animation, and texture changing
but these new additions can NOT still be sold, put on other websites, 
or shared freely.

All models are created by SDAssets.

-------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The wall knives, beds and characters are NOT included in this pack
-------------------------------------------------

Due to Smile Game Builder limitations with models some models are in
parts, such as the sink, cooker, and wall unit. In SGB you can place
all the parts down, highlight them all, right click and choose Group 
to put them all into one model for easier movement.

-------------------------------------------------

The Unedited builds folder contain blender files where the models are 
not edited, they are the original builds before being edited for SGB.

-------------------------------------------------

Hope you enjoy these models.
